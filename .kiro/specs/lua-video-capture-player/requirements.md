# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing a comprehensive video capture and playback system for Windows using Lua. The system will support multiple video sources including screen capture, window capture, and webcam input, with real-time playback capabilities. The implementation will leverage LuaJIT's FFI to interface with Windows APIs and use LÖVE 2D as the graphics framework for display and user interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture my desktop screen in real-time, so that I can record or stream my desktop activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates screen capture THEN the system SHALL capture the entire desktop using Windows GDI+ BitBlt or DXGI Desktop Duplication API
2. WHEN screen capture is active THEN the system SHALL provide frame data at a configurable frame rate (15-60 FPS)
3. WHEN capturing screen THEN the system SHALL handle multiple monitor setups correctly
4. IF the system encounters capture errors THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages and attempt recovery

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture specific application windows, so that I can focus on particular applications without capturing my entire desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests window capture THEN the system SHALL enumerate all available windows with their titles
2. WHEN a specific window is selected THEN the system SHALL capture only that window's content using FindWindow and BitBlt APIs
3. WHEN the target window is minimized or hidden THEN the system SHALL handle the state gracefully and notify the user
4. IF the target window is moved or resized THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust the capture area

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture video from my webcam, so that I can include camera input in my recordings or streams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL enumerate all available video capture devices using DirectShow or Media Foundation
2. WHEN a webcam is selected THEN the system SHALL initialize the device and begin capturing frames
3. WHEN webcam capture is active THEN the system SHALL provide configurable resolution and frame rate options
4. IF webcam access fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about permissions or device availability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view captured video in real-time, so that I can monitor what is being captured and verify the quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video capture is active THEN the system SHALL display the video feed in a LÖVE 2D window with minimal latency
2. WHEN displaying video THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio and provide scaling options
3. WHEN the user interacts with playback controls THEN the system SHALL respond immediately to play, pause, and stop commands
4. IF frame processing falls behind THEN the system SHALL drop frames to maintain real-time performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control video capture and playback through an intuitive interface, so that I can easily manage my recording sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN it SHALL present a user interface with clearly labeled capture source options
2. WHEN the user selects a capture source THEN the system SHALL provide relevant configuration options (resolution, frame rate, etc.)
3. WHEN capture is active THEN the system SHALL display recording status, elapsed time, and current frame rate
4. WHEN the user wants to switch sources THEN the system SHALL allow seamless transitions between different capture modes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to efficiently interface with Windows APIs, so that performance is optimized and system resources are used effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making Windows API calls THEN the system SHALL use LuaJIT's FFI for direct C API access without performance overhead
2. WHEN processing video frames THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations and copying operations
3. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL release unnecessary resources and reduce CPU usage
4. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection strategies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video player to support overlay and transparency features, so that I can create picture-in-picture displays or overlay effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN overlay mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL create a borderless, always-on-top window
2. WHEN transparency is configured THEN the system SHALL support alpha blending for semi-transparent overlays
3. WHEN positioning overlays THEN the system SHALL allow user-defined placement and sizing
4. IF multiple overlays are active THEN the system SHALL manage z-order and prevent conflicts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't crash the application or corrupt recordings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt recovery
2. WHEN capture devices become unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect the change and notify the user
3. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL reduce quality settings automatically to maintain stability
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL save current state and provide recovery options on restart
