# Performance Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Task 11: Add Performance Monitoring and Optimization

This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization features for the Lua Video Capture Player.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Performance Monitor Module (`src/performance_monitor.lua`)

Created a dedicated performance monitoring system that provides:

#### Real-time Performance Metrics Collection

- **Frame Timing**: Measures frame processing time with statistical analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors current, average, and peak memory consumption
- **Session Statistics**: Tracks total frames processed, dropped, and skipped

#### Frame Dropping Mechanism

- **Automatic Frame Dropping**: Activates when performance falls below thresholds
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable performance targets and drop criteria
- **Recovery Detection**: Automatically stops dropping when performance improves
- **Drop Statistics**: Tracks drop rates and patterns

#### Performance State Management

- **Three Performance States**: Good, Warning, Critical
- **Threshold-based Detection**: Automatically categorizes performance issues
- **Callback System**: Notifies when performance state changes
- **Recommendations Engine**: Provides actionable performance improvement suggestions

### 2. Integration with Capture Engine

Enhanced the existing capture engine with performance monitoring:

#### Seamless Integration

- **Memory Management**: Tracks and optimizes memory usage during capture
- **Error Recovery**: Performance-based error handling and recovery

### 3. UI Performance Display

Extended the UI controller to display real-time performance metrics:

#### Performance Overlay

- **Real-time Display**: Shows current FPS, memory usage, and performance state
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for performance state (good/warning/critical)
- **Configurable Position**: Moveable performance display overlay
- **Toggle Support**: Can be enabled/disabled via keyboard shortcut ('P' key)

#### Performance Recommendations

- **Context-aware Suggestions**: Shows relevant performance improvement tips
- **Dynamic Updates**: Recommendations change based on current performance issues
- **User-friendly Format**: Clear, actionable advice for users

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

Implemented extensive test coverage for performance monitoring:

#### Unit Tests (`tests/test_performance_monitor.lua`)

- Performance monitor initialization and configuration
- Metrics collection accuracy
- Frame dropping logic
- Memory monitoring functionality
- Performance threshold detection
- Callback system verification

#### Integration Tests (`tests/test_performance_integration.lua`)

- Capture engine integration

#### Stress Tests (`tests/test_performance_stress.lua`)

- High frame rate stress testing (120 FPS)
- Memory pressure testing
- Extended capture session testing (10+ seconds)
- Rapid source switching performance
- Concurrent performance monitoring
- Frame drop recovery testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Monitor Architecture

```lua
PerformanceMonitor = {
    -- Configuration
    enabled = true,
    target_fps = 30,
    frame_drop_enabled = true,
    memory_monitoring = true,

    -- Metrics Collection
    metrics = {
        current_fps, average_fps, min_fps, max_fps,
        frame_time, average_frame_time,
        current_memory, peak_memory,
        frames_processed, frames_dropped, frames_skipped
    },

    -- Frame Dropping Logic
    frame_dropping = {
        consecutive_slow_frames,
        drop_threshold,
        currently_dropping,
        recovery_threshold
    }
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Capture Engine**: Automatic performance monitoring during capture
2. **UI Controller**: Real-time performance display and user controls
3. **Frame Buffer**: Memory usage tracking and optimization
4. **Error Handler**: Performance-based error detection and recovery

### Performance Thresholds

- **Target FPS Tolerance**: 90% of target frame rate
- **Critical FPS Threshold**: 15 FPS minimum
- **Memory Warning**: 100 MB usage threshold
- **Memory Critical**: 200 MB usage threshold
- **Frame Time Warning**: 50ms per frame
- **Frame Time Critical**: 100ms per frame

## Usage Examples

### Basic Performance Monitoring

```lua
local engine = CaptureEngine:new({
    frame_rate = 30,
    monitor_performance = true,
    frame_drop_enabled = true,
    memory_monitoring = true
})

-- Get performance metrics
local metrics = engine:getPerformanceMonitor():getMetrics()
print("Current FPS: " .. metrics.current_fps)
print("Memory Usage: " .. metrics.current_memory .. " MB")
print("Performance State: " .. metrics.performance_state)
```

### UI Performance Display

```lua
-- Toggle performance display with 'P' key
-- Performance overlay shows:
-- - Current FPS / Average FPS
-- - Frame processing time
-- - Memory usage
-- - Performance state (Good/Warning/Critical)
-- - Frame drop statistics
-- - Session duration
```

### Performance Recommendations

The system provides context-aware recommendations such as:

- "Consider reducing capture resolution or frame rate" (for low FPS)
- "High memory usage - consider reducing buffer size" (for memory issues)
- "Frame processing is very slow - check system resources" (for timing issues)
